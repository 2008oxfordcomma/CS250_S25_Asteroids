#  CS250 - Asteroids

##  Project Overview
This is my final project for **CS250: Algorithms and Problem-Solving II**, where I am recreating the classic 1979 Atari arcade game **Asteroids**. I previously attempted a version in JavaScript but was limited by time, so this project is my opportunity to develop a functional remake using **LibGDX**.

##  Features
While sticking with the original gameplay, Iâ€™m adding improvements to bring the game up to date, including:

- **Core Mechanics**:
  - Large asteroids break into smaller, faster-moving pieces when shot.
  - Two types of enemy saucers:  
    -  Large saucer fires randomly.  
    -  Small saucer targets the player and becomes more accurate as the score increases.
  - New waves spawn when all asteroids and saucers are cleared.
  - Classic **3-5 lives** system with an extra life every **10,000 points**.

- **Planned Enhancements**:
  -  **Parallax background** for a sense of depth in space.
  -  **Perlin noise-generated asteroids** for infinite variations.
  -  **Radial explosions** and simple color accents for a modern aesthetic.
  -  **High Score Leaderboard** saved across sessions.
  -  **Light/Dark Mode & Sound Toggle** in the game menu.

## Development Note
Since performance is a concern with **Java Swing**, I am learning **LibGDX** to implement this project.
